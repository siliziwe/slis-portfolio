    <p>My name is Siliziwe and I'm 19 years old. I grew up and currently live in Cape Town, Khayelitsha. I finished matric in 2021. I love playing sport and gaming. <br>
        Most of my time I spend listening to music. I also enjoy drawing and making animation. I've always wanted to be a professional animator but right now I'm focusing <br>
        on developing my skills as a software developer. I think with these skills I will bring about change in the developing world. I know that technology is the key <br>
        to solving most of the world's problems.<br>
        <br> I am an innnovative person and I am able to use my perceptive mind to come up with solutions. Hiring me for a sofftware job would be the a good decision <br>
        beacuse I am very good at breaking down problems and looking for ways to solve them. I'm also good at working with a team eventhough I enjoy working alone sometimes. <br>
        I am able to find humour and make everyone laugh when needed.<br>
        <br>As I have mentioned, I've always wanted to be a pro animator and fictional story artist, well it's because I have an extraordinary imagination filled with amazing and<br>
        creative ideas. When I'm not coding, I spend my time making basic animations on programs like Stick Nodes, Blender, and flipaclip but mostly use and prefer Stick Nodes.<br>
        So yeah, that's what my other passion is and I'm very good at it.</p>
